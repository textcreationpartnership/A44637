            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THERE is ordinarily ſo little either Wiſdom or Generoſity in moſt Men, that they are almoſt wholly taken up with their own private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or Pleaſures, with a Neglect of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Safety and Welfare of the Nation. For thô many enquire much after the State of it, whether to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their idle Moments, or gratifie their Curioſity, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49406:4"/>in the general they wiſh well to it, or for other ends: yet few comparatively make it a main part of their Buſineſs to promote its Happineſs. And even amongſt theſe, how few are there that rightly underſtand the true Intereſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſeriouſly apply themſelves to thoſe Means that are neceſſary to advance it! Now what theſe are, King <hi>Solomon,</hi> a Perſon in the higheſt Station, and of the greateſt Wiſdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, (and therefore fitteſt to judge of the Intereſt of a Kingdom,) has told us from his own Wiſdom and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and which is more, from the Wiſdom of God himſelf, including them in one comprehenſive word in my Text, <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation.</hi> And to aſſure us that in the want of this, no other Methods can be ſufficient, he adds, <hi>But ſin is a reproach to any people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are therefore two plain Propoſitions that fully inſtruct us, the one what will make a Nation Happy; and the other what will as certainly make it Miſerable. If we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Subject of this moment before us, and wherein we are all nearly concern'd, I hope none will blame me, if I handle it with that Plainneſs and Freedom which the Conſequence of the thing itſelf, the preſent State of the Nation, the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Times, and the Neceſſity of every one of Us here preſent do call for therefore in ſpeaking to theſe words, I ſhall endeavour to Explain and Confirm both the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their order, and then draw ſuch Inferences from them as are moſt ſeaſonable, bringing the Matter down to this Time, and the preſent Occaſion of our meeting together.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation:</hi> In relation to which words I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What is here meant by Righteouſneſs.</item>
               <item>2. How it exalts a Nation.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Righteouſneſs in a ſtrict ſence is as much as Juſtice; and it is often uſed in Scripture to ſignifie Charity, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that branch of it which is exerciſed in ſupplying the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49406:4"/>Wants of poor indigent People: but in my Text it is to be underſtood in a greater Latitude, and is the ſame with Virtue or Goodneſs, or Obedience to God in the general; as appears in that it is ſet in Oppoſition to Sin (by which is meant all manner of Wickedneſs,) in the latter part of the Verſe: And this ſence of the Word is ſo ordinary in the Holy Scriptures, and ſo obvious to every one, as well as neceſſary to the wiſe Man's Purpoſe in this place, that I need not ſay any thing more in the proof of it. Therefore I proceed to ſhew.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation:</hi> That is, raiſes it higher, in making it better, and cauſing it to abound with every thing that may be of real Advantage to it. But there are ſo many Reſpects and Inſtances wherein a Nation is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and ſo many Branches of Righteouſneſs, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to it, that it would make too great a part of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to repreſent them all: therefore I ſhall only ſpeak to the chief of them, as briefly as I can, but ſufficiently, I hope, to ſatisfie all ſober and unprejudiced Hearers.</p>
            <p>Righteouſneſs is the greateſt Endowment that our beſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are capable of, and far more excellent than all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Benefits: <hi>For</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays of Wiſdom, which is the ſame thing under another name, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.14, 15.) <hi>the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of it is better then the merchandiſe of ſilver, and the gain thereof then fine gold. She is more precious then rubies: and all the things thou canst deſire, are not to be compared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her.</hi> Yea, it raiſes us above the State of meer rational Beings, and renews us after the Image of GOD, and makes us Followers of him in a Divine Converſation. If a Nation therefore be advanced by a Plenty of Corn and Wine, by the Health, and Strength, and Numbers of the People, or by Forreign Rarities for Delight and Ornament; how much more then by the true Riches of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> that Righteouſneſs which comes down from thence, and at once ennobles the Souls and adorns the Converſation of them that have it?</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49406:5"/>
            <p>But that I may ſpeak more ſenſibly to thoſe Men who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may receive this rather as a ſine Speculation, then a real Truth; I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs produces all thoſe Effects to a Nation which in the general Opinion of Men do exalt it, as Health and Strength, Riches, Honour, Friendſhip, Security, Delight, and Comfort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that both as a Natural and a Moral Cauſe of them.</p>
            <p n="1">It is a natural Cauſe of theſe Benefits, to which nothing can conduce ſo much as that honeſt and regular ways of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving which true Religion requires: We do not only avoid the Cauſes of Bodily Diſtempers and Weakneſſes, but much improve alſo in Health and Strength by many Habits of Righteouſneſs, as Meekneſs, Patience, and Contentation, but eſpecially Temperance in both the Branches of it, Sobriety and Chaſtity, and Diligence alſo in ſome honeſt Calling that is ſuitable to us. I hope I need not ſay how much the Vices contrary to theſe impair the beſt Natural Conſtitution, bring many Diſeaſes upon the Body, and surprize Men with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Death; ſince it has been obſerv'd, and not without rational Evidence, that Gluttony itſelf kills more then the Sword. And as for Riches, the very ſame Vertues that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove us in Health and Strength, do thereby fit us to uſe the moſt proper means of increaſing in them alſo, which ſeldom fail of attaining their end; for the diligent hand maketh rich, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. Whereas <hi>the drunkard and the glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſhall come to poverty: and drowſineſs ſhall clothe a man with rags,</hi> Prov. 23.21. Induſtry makes the Earth and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters profitable to us, and fetches home the Fruits and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the remoteſt Countries, to ſupply what may be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our own: For though God in much Wiſdom and Goodneſs, hath ſo ſutably diſpenſed his Bleſſings to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts of the World, that they ordinarily afford the moſt convenient Food, Phyſick, and Clothing to the Inhabitants; yet he doth not ſo equally proportion theſe, but that it is often neceſſary that the Plenty of ſome ſhould ſupply the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49406:5"/>Scarcity of others. And there is in every one ſomething pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, that ſerveth, if not the Neceſſity, yet the Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Delight of other Countries; that Nations might be ſenſible of a mutual Dependance on one another, to encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Amity between them, and to excite their Induſtry, by which each of them may, even from all Parts of the Earth, enrich their own Country. What ſhall we ſay of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with which Righteouſneſs exalts a Nation? There is certainly nothing can gain it ſo great a Reputation in the World as this: It adds ſuch a Luſtre to all that are endow'd with it, as makes them venerable in the eyes of others: For it is from hence that Men are deliberate in their Counſels, grave in their Deportment, faithful in their Dealings, juſt to their Promiſes, compaſſionate to the Miſerable, humble and obliging to all Perſons. And theſe Vertues do naturally gain a Reputation to thoſe that have them: therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of God's Commands, exhorts <hi>Iſrael</hi> to keep and do them, from this Motive. That it would be their Wiſdom and Underſtanding in the ſight of the Nations, who on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count would ſay, <hi>Surely this great nation is a wiſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding people,</hi> Deut. 4.6.</p>
            <p>Now the ſame Vertues that get Honour and Reputation to a People, do alſo allure the Affections of the Nations, and cauſe them to enter into Affinities and Leagues with them: And indeed what Prince or People would not promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great Advantages from ſuch an Alliance? They who are obſerv'd to practice Righteouſneſs in all their Relations at home, will never be ſuſpected of Unfaithfulneſs towards their Allies abroad; and the more they are improved by a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and induſtrious way of living, the better are they fitted to ſerve the ends of ſuch an Union. And then a further Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of theſe Things will be the greater Security of a Nation ſo endowed with Righteouſneſs, and ſtrengthened with Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances on the account of it: beſides, thoſe good Habits and Exerciſes which naturally improve Health and Strength (as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49406:6"/>I ſhewed before) do alſo ſit Men for the Defence of their Country, when any Attempts are made upon it by their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. And a Love and good Will to our Neighbours, and a Zeal for the Publick Good, as they prevent Civil Breaches and Contentions in a People among themſelves, ſo they migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily unite and ſtrengthen them againſt a forreign Enemy; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when they are animated alſo by that true Courage which is another Branch of Righteouſneſs. To theſe I ſhall add, as the Reſult of them all, as well as an immediate Effect of Righteouſneſs, that inward Peace and Satisfaction, that ſweet Delight and Comfort which a Nation fearing God, and working Righteouſneſs are ſure to enjoy: for this ariſes from the very Nature of Vertue, which conſiſts in a Rectitude that muſt needs be very agreeable to a Mind diſpoſed for it; and it is alſo one of its main Offices to govern thoſe Paſſions that interrupt our inward Peace, and direct them to ſuch Objects as afford a pleaſing Converſation to us. And there is no ſmall addition to theſe Comforts from a Conſcience of thoſe Habits, together with a due Exerciſe of them in a vertuous Life; and ſomething alſo (as was before hinted) from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral outward Advantages with which Righteouſneſs does exalt a Nation; which are ſumm'd up by <hi>Solomon</hi> in a few words, that atteſt all I have mentioned under this Head, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.16, 17. where ſpeaking of Wiſdom, he ſays, <hi>Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Righteouſneſs exalts a Nation in procuring ſuch Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to it as a Moral Cauſe, in that it qualifies them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe more abundantly by the Bleſſing of Almighty God, as the Anſwer of their Prayers, and a Reward of their Righteouſneſs, according to the many Promiſes he has given us, both in the Old and New Teſtament. The Lord often aſſures his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in them all other Nations, that if they would be obedient to his Laws, they ſhould be blessed in all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49406:6"/>their Temporal Concerns, but moſt fully and particularly, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. Our Saviour has alſo aſſur'd us of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bleſſings upon Condition we firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.33. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That <hi>godlineſs is profitable to all things,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. It is evident then, if a Nation be righteous, the Lord who loves Righteouſneſs will be with them, to give them all thoſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which will make them the Admiration as well as the Envy and Dread of other Nations, who will have juſt reaſon to confeſs, That <hi>happy is that people that is in ſuch a caſe: yea, happy is that people, whoſe God is the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 144.15. I come now to the latter part of my Text:</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Sin is a reproach to any people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though theſe words are interpreted with ſome little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference by learned Men, yet our Tranſlation agrees well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with the Original, and is authoriſed alſo by the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> Paraphraſe: and whereas the Septuagint and other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Verſions render it, <hi>But ſins do diminiſh the Tribes, or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or Nations;</hi> and the Vulgar <hi>Latine, That ſin makes the People miſerable.</hi> All this gives us a further Confirmation of the ſame Sence in different Terms; and therefore we may without doing Violence to the Text, or perverting the wiſe Man's Intention in this place, put them all together, and ſo they will ſtand in a more plain and full Oppoſition to the former part of the Verſe: And if I ſhall prove to you, That <hi>ſin is a reproach to a people,</hi> both immediately in itſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely in its Effects; this will take in all the Differences of the ſeveral Verſions and Interpretations of the Words:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is ſo immediately and in itſelf: If it be a Shame for an intelligent Being to act below his Understanding, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his nobleſt Faculties to the will of his ſenſual Appetite; then Sin is a Shame and a Reproach to us: Can a Prince without Diſhonour ſubmit himſelf to the meaneſt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or the Maſter become a Slave to his Servant? No
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49406:7"/>more can the Soul of Man without the greateſt Diminution to its Worth and Dignity, ſtoop to the vile Servitude of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Affections. If to chooſe a little baſe Profit, or Delight, or Reputation, and Friendſhip with the worſt of Men, for a few Moments, as if it were their only Felicity, and thereby venture the loſs of true and Eternal Happineſs, which after a ſhort and uncertain time they might otherwiſe enjoy, be a Reproach to them who are capable of conſidering both the one and the other, who confeſs they have immortal Souls, and cannot deny but they expoſe them to great Dangers by this means, and have alſo rational Grounds of Belief, that a Courſe of Piety would afford them greater Delight and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction even in this Life: (for the very Heathens could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that Vertue is a Reward to itſelf, and even with the meaneſt and moſt miſerable Condition, is preferable to all outward Advantages without it:) Then if there be any ſuch thing as Folly in the World, there muſt lie a juſt Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it on ſuch Perſons as thus court their own Miſery, and deſpiſe their Happineſs. Therefore it is no wonder, that <hi>Solomon</hi> does ordinarily in this Book of <hi>Proverbs</hi> call wicked Men Fools; and yet what greater Contempt can he caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them then this? Foraſmuch as Wiſdom raiſes Mens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and makes them Honourable, ſo much does Folly render them Mean and Deſpicable in the World. And does not Sin do the ſame thing alſo? If we ſpeak of the ſence which all Perſons that retain any love for Vertue have of it, the matter is without queſtion. If a Man has the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Drunkard, a Whoremonger, or a covetous Perſon; if he be accounted Proud, Deceitful, or Malicious; if he be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Lying, Prophaneneſs, or Unſeemly Communication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how extreamly does this leſſen him in the Eſteem of all good Men? Yea, if he has never ſo excellent Gifts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Fortune, (as they are call'd) if he is poſſeſs'd of a good Eſtate, if he has the beſt Accompliſhments of Body, and the greateſt natural and acquir'd Endowments of Soul, as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49406:7"/>Judgment, Wit, Learning, Arts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all theſe are ſo diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome ill Habits in his Converſation, that he loſes, for the moſt part, the Credit of them. Nay, to go further yet, if to all theſe Advantages there be added many Moral Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications too; if a Perſon be of a free and generous Mind, an humble Carriage, a compaſſionate Temper, and yet lives in the Sin of Drunkenneſs, or Uncleanneſs, or if he appears ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo exactly chaſt and ſober, but at the ſame time is known to be covetous and oppreſſing, theſe baſe Vices do more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine and betray his Reputation, then all other Vertues can contribute to it. And they do this not only in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of honeſt and innocent Men, but of thoſe alſo, in a great meaſure, who are guilty of as bad, if not the ſame Faults themſelves; for it is uſual with moſt Men to cenſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe thoſe very Sins in their Neighbours, which they indulge in their own Perſons: as if they thought a greater Liberty is allow'd to them then to others; or elſe, becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their own Faults with the moſt extenuating Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, while they look upon other Mens with the greateſt Aggravations. So that if it ſhould be put to a general Vote, whether Sin be not a Reproach and Diſhonour to any People, they would ſo univerſally agree in the Affirmative, that very few would be found to make any Exception, unleſs it were for one ſingle Perſon? But what reſerve ſoever any may have out of Partiality to their own Perſons, in relation to this matter; yet the Judgment they paſs upon all others would be a concluding Sentence againſt themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sin is a Reproach to any People in its Effects alſo: That many Sins do naturally tend to the making Men miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the World, is ſo evident, that I need not ſpend time in proving it; eſpecially ſince I have given you already ſome Hints of it in ſpeaking to the former part of my Text. The Sins of Pride, Luxury. Intemperance, and Strife are very great Waſters, and have ruined many thouſands in their Eſtates, and ſome of them many more in their Health and Strength:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49406:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>The former of theſe Caſes does too ordinarily expoſe Men to Contempt, even when it comes by the hand of Providence. But when Poverty is the natural Effect of Mens Sins, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes juſtly a Reproach to them: And ſo are theſe Pains and Diſeaſes alſo, and whatſoever other Calamities Men bring upon themſelves by a vicious Life. And to theſe God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many times to add others, alſo upon obſtinate Sinners, to vindicate his Juſtice and Holineſs in the World, eſpecially when the Sins become National, and Judgment is not executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as it ought, by his Vice-gerents. And when-ever theſe come upon a People, they bring a great Reproach with them; according to that Threatning ſent by the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> to the Remnant left at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the time of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.18. <hi>I will perſecute them with the ſword, with the famine, and with the peſtilence, and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curſe, and an aſtoniſhment, and an hiſſing, and a reproach among all the nations whither I have driven them.</hi> And indeed in ſuch caſes there is no leſs then a threefold Reproach lies upon a Nation, Judgment is a Work which God uſes as the laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, when all other Methods fail of accompliſhing his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Purpoſes upon a People. And it is uſually a great while, after much Waiting and Forbearance, e're he comes to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity: whenſoever therefore any of his Judgments are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon Sinners, they are ſo many Reproaches from him for their great Impieties, moſt ungratefully continued in not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the effects of his Love and Mercy, by which he would have led them to Repentance, and obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd againſt all tile Patience he had long exerciſed towards them, and the many Threatnings of Judgment he had given them both in his Word and Providences, to draw them to it. And God in his Wiſdom does uſually ſend ſuch Judgments upon a People as are moſt ſuitable to their Sins, that they may be more viſible Reproaches to them: As when he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes a divided and contentious Nation with open Wars, a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49406:8"/>luxurious People with Hunger and Nakedneſs, or the Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious that burn in their Luſts, with the deſtroying Heats of a Plague, or devouring Fires in their Towns and Cities. Of all which Caſes, and ſeveral others, it would be eaſie to give many Inſtances. 2. There is a Reproach alſo in ſuch caſes from the World, (as was ſhew'd before,) becauſe of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery a People is involv'd in by reaſon of theſe Judgments. 3. And if they themſelves have any fence, they muſt needs be reproach'd too by their own Conſciences, that they have dealt ſo unworthily with their God, ſo treacherouſly with their own Souls, and ſo fooliſhly undermin'd alſo their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Happineſs: And then they may well (with <hi>Ephraim</hi>) be aſham'd and confounded when they thus bear their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.19.</p>
            <p>You have now heard how Sin is a Reproach to any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both in itſelf and its Effects: So that if ſome read the words, it diminiſhes or makes them miſerable; this comes all to the ſame thing, becauſe in theſe Effects it is a Reproach to a People, as well as in itſelf.</p>
            <p>Now what has been ſaid upon both the parts of my Text, might abundantly confirm to you from God's dealing with Men in all Ages: And indeed it would be hard to find a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that has not been an Inſtance of the truth of it. God has at all times bleſſed a People, and made them proſperous ſo long as they continued faithful to him in thoſe main Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Piety, Juſtice, and Temperance, as they are taught by the Law of Nature, where they had no better a Light to guide them; and on the contrary, when they degenerated from theſe Vertues, and ſunk into a State of Impiety, Idleneſs, and Luxury, they have been conquer'd and ruin'd by a more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and vertuous Nation, whom God had rais'd up to execute his Vengeance upon them. This has been ſo common a caſe in the World, that whoſoever looks into Hiſtory, will eaſily ſee that from theſe Cauſes have been all the great Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Empires and Kingdoms, even to this day. But I ſhall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49406:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>content myſelf with inſtancing particularly in the Caſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory deſerves the greateſt Regard from us, not only as it is very remarkable in itſelf, but in that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to us in Records of unqueſtionable Authority; we ſee therefore in the ſacred Hiſtory of that Nation, while they ſerv'd God in the days of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and of the Elders that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd him, they were bleſſed, with conſtant Victories over their Enemies, and enjoy'd the Fruits and Delights of a moſt fertile Country: But when after this they tell from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, he gave them up to ſerve their Enemies that cruelly oppreſſed them. And tho' he ſtill deliver'd them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Repentance, yet as often as they revolted from him again, he reduc'd them to the ſame Miſery; ſo that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd many a long and ſevere Bondage under ſeveral neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes and People, as we read in the Book of <hi>Judges.</hi> And afterwards, ſo long as they were any thing mindful of their Duty to God, and obey'd his Laws, he bleſſed them more then any People; their Tribes were multiplied to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and tho' the Land of their Reſidence was very ſmall, and unfit, one would think, to ſuſtain ſo great a Multitude, yet they abounded continually with all manner of Proviſions, notwithſtanding every ſeventh Year they received not any Fruits from the Earth: And God inſpired them with ſuch Courage, and gave them ſuch Succeſſes in their Wars, that they became a Terrour to all Nations about them. But when they forget God their Saviour, who had done ſuch great things for them, and fell into the practice of many foul Sins, they receiv'd from his hand one heavy Judgment after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſeveral times became a Prey to their Enemies, who led them into Captivity, firſt one part and then another; and at length, when to all their former Sins they had added the Crucifying of the <hi>Lord of Life,</hi> and Perſecuting his Diſciples, they were ſoon deſtroyed from being a Nation, and thoſe ſmall Remains that ſurvived ſo great a Slaughter as was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-where made of them by the <hi>Romans,</hi> were ſcatter'd into
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49406:9"/>many remote Parts of the World, and are every-where a By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word and a Reproach unto this day. All which fell out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly according to what God had in many Ages foretold them by his Prophets, and at laſt by our Bleſſed Saviour; and is alſo related by <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his excellent Hiſtory, who to the Story of that People in the Scriptures, has added a full and exact Account of their final Deſtruction, which in thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writings was only foretold.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to draw ſuch Inferences from theſe Words as are moſt neceſſary, which in the general are but two; the former relating to the latter part of my Text, and the other to both, under which I ſhall ſpeak to ſeveral particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. If Sin be a Reproach to any People, then eſpecially to ſuch as have been beſt inform'd of their Duty, and receiv'd the greateſt Motives to be Righteous: Now of all Nations in the World, God has moſt abounded to us in both theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages: The Goſpel is moſt plainly and fully preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and beſides the Holy Scriptures, which are every-where to be read in our own Language, there ſo many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Practical Diſcourſes for the explaining and applying thoſe Sacred Oracles, that none who can either read or hear can pretend Ignorance of their Duty. And as to our Motives to be Righteous, (to ſay nothing of the natural Advantages of our Country which are very great,) I muſt put you in mind of the great Deliverance of this Nation from the Darkneſs and Oppreſſions of Popery, and from all the Attempts made to bring it back upon us for above Eighty Years together, with a conſtant Peace within our Borders, and a Proſperity that was envied by our Neighbours during all that time. But when this would not make us fear God, and love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as became good Chriſtians, our private Animoſities were puniſhed with a moſt Unnatural Inteſtine War, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miſeries that attended and follow'd it: And when, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years, God had reſtored us to a flouriſhing State, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged us by new Favours to be faithful to him; ſeeing theſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49406:10"/>had not thoſe good Effects upon us as might be expected, he viſited us with a dreadful Plague that very much depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the chief City of our Nation, and deſtroyed many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands in other places; and ſoon after it, with a devouring Fire that laid the Glory of that City in Aſhes, together with ſo many other Fires in the Kingdom within a few Years, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had not been ſeen any where before in a time of Peace. And about the ſame time God ſuffer'd us to be drawn into a War once and again, that was never like to be much for our Credit or Advantage. And during that Reign eſpecially, Men were given up to ſo ſtrange an Infatuation as to ſuffer themſelves to be exaſperated one againſt another upon very ſmall Grounds, by the treacherous Inſinuations of ſuch Men as knew well enough what Advantages to expect from our Diviſions: But yet the Lord did not bring upon us the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of thoſe Sins, nor deliver us into the Hands of thoſe cruel Men that were for dividing us only that they might deſtroy us; but their Plots and Deſigns againſt us were diſcover'd, and prevented from time to time; and tho' they gather'd Strength and Intereſt nothwithſtanding, thro' the Eaſineſs of ſome amongſt us, and the Impotency of others, till at laſt they ſeem'd to have Power enough in their Hands to do their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs by open Force, and we ſaw ourſelves with all our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Intereſts at the Brink of Ruine; and which might ſtrike coldeſt to us of any thing, we could ſee nothing in all this, but the Natural, or at leaſt the Moral Effects of our own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; yet even at this time, when our Enemies were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of finiſhing their Work, and we had even given up ourſelves for loſt, as Men without Hope; our gracious God would not give us up too, tho' we had ſo much provoked him: As if he had the ſame Relentings for us, as for <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, when he thus ſpeaks by his Prophet <hi>Hosea, How ſhall I give thee up Ephraim? how ſhall I deliver thee Iſrael? how ſhall I make thee as Admah? how ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49406:10"/>Hoſ. 11.8. And, bleſſed be his Name! we ſoon found the gracious Effects of ſuch a Compaſſion, and by thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wonders of Providence which made our late happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, and the great Succeſſes God has ſince given us, we find ourſelves a free People, in the Enjoyment of our Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Religion, under the beſt temper'd Government in the World. And tho' the neighbouring Nations engaged in the ſame Cauſe with us, have endur'd all the dreadful Miſeries of War, yet we have felt nothing of it (in the general) but the Payment of Taxes towards it; which no good Man will grudge at, that knows they are the Price of our Eſtates, our Liberties, our Lives, and which is more than all our Religion. <hi>Now after all that is come upon us for our evil Deeds,</hi> (as <hi>Ezra</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>ſeeing that our God hath puniſhed us leſs then our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities deserve, and has given us ſuch a Deliverance as this, ſhould we again break his Commandments, would he not be angry with us till he had, conſum'd us, ſo that there ſhould be no Remnant nor Eſcaping?</hi> You ſee therefore what Motives we have to depart from Sin, and embrace Righteouſneſs. God has continually enrich'd us with his Mercies; he has exercis'd great Patience towards us, and wrought many wonderful Deliverances for us, notwithſtanding our heinous Sins and Rebellions againſt him; he has alſo executed ſome Judgments upon us, and threatned us with more amt greater yet, if we do not return to him: Yea, we have Motives from our very Sins; for is it not yet enough that we have tranſgreſs'd the Laws of our God, and rebell'd againſt him? Hath the Lord often repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Evil be threatned us with? And ſhall not we yet repent of our evil Temper and Practices againſt him? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is high time, after ſo long a Defection, to return to ourselves, and to our God. And does trot the preſent State of our Affairs too loudly call for it? God ſtill gives usVicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but yet the finiſhing part of our Happineſs is kept in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence, which upon a ſincere Reformation of our Lives, we may hope for: but if we come ſhort of this, we ſhall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49406:11"/>(in all likelihood) prevent ſuch a Bleſſing, but loſe the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he has already given us, and become a Prey to the Malice and Fury of the worſt Men in the World: And would not this be an indelible Reproach to ſuch a People as we are, that of all Nations in the World ſhould beſt underſtand our Duty to God, and have more Obligations to do it than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>
            <p n="2">2. From both the parts of my Text we ſee how much it lies upon us to depart from Sin, and to do Righteouſneſs: And that I may uſe the fitteſt way to perſwade you to it, I ſhall,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Apply myſelf particularly to ſeveral Ranks and Orders of Men in the Nation, of which ſome are here preſent.</item>
               <item>2. Speak to all in general.</item>
               <item>3. Conclude with what concerns the Buſineſs of this time, and the preſent Occaſion of our meeting together.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall apply myſelf particularly to ſeveral Ranks and Orders of Men in the Nation, namely, Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and Gentlemen.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall with all that Humility and Reſpect that becomes me, addreſs myſelf to Magiſtrates, whether in an higher or a lower Station, and deſire you would be pleas'd to conſider how much the Honour of your Places, the Truſt repoſed in you by Almighty God, and the Princes he has ſet over us, and the juſt Expectations of all good Men do require that ye ſhould be Righteous, both in your Perſons and in your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. When <hi>Jethro</hi> advis'd <hi>Moſes</hi> to chuſe Magiſtrates under him, to aſſiſt him in Judging the People, he mentions the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Qualifications of ſuch Men, Exod. 18.21. <hi>Able men, ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs.</hi> And when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks to the People about this Matter, a little before his Death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.13. he gives another part of the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of theſe Perſons, namely, <hi>Wiſe men and underſtanding, and known among the tribes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Magiſtrates therefore ought to be wiſe Men, whoſe Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49406:11"/>and Knowledge is above the common Rate, who having furniſhed their Minds with the beſt Rules and Nations, are able to penetrate doubtful and difficult Cauſes, and diſcover Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs under all thoſe Diſguiſes by which it is ſhelter'd from common Obſervation: And to this Wiſdom muſt be added Underſtanding too, that is, Prudence, (in the fence of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal) not ſuch as would direct them to conſult their own Safety, rather then execute Juſtice when their perſons or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates may be in danger by it, (for this is a baſe Craft that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermines and betrays a Nation, and therefore deſerves not the name of Prudence) but that which enables Magiſtrates to judge of particular Caſes with relation to Times, Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to do every part of their Duty with ſuch neceſſary Precautions as may beſt ſerve the ends of it. Then they muſt be able Men, that is vertuous, (in the Original) or more particularly Men of Valour and Courage, which is always neceſſary to a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, <hi>That he may break the jaws of the Wicked,</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.17) <hi>and pluck the ſpoil out of his teeth:</hi> That is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them that fuſſer under the cruel Oppreſſor, how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoever, and execute Judgment on the proudeſt and moſt proſperous Offender. To this muſt be added the Fear of God, which is to direct and govern them in all their Actions, wherein they are to have reſpect rather to God then Man, and to his Will and Honour, then to any Temporal Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. And then they will be Men of Truth too, that is of Juſtice, (as in the Septuagint Verſion) for Truth is a branch of Juſtice, and this, in every part, has ſo near a Reſemblance to Truth, that it may well enough be call'd by that name. To this is added hating Covetouſneſs, (which indeed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer parts of the Character do neceſſarily infer,) and without this it is hard to imagine how they ſhould have either Juſtice or Courage enough to do their Duty in any tolerable meaſure, and to be ſure the Fear of God would be far from them: the very name of covetouſneſs is ſo provoking to one that has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſparks of Generoſity, that it is hard for him to mention it without the ſharpeſt Invectives: He that can ſtoop to ſuch a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49406:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>Luſt as this, is not ſit to be truſted with any Buſineſs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for his Soul is not capable of thoſe noble Thoughts and Reſolutions that make Men honeſt and faithful to their Truſt; and that greater Affection he bears to his little Deities, will eaſily bring him off from the weaker Ties of Friendſhip or Loyalty; ſo that whenever there ſhall ariſe a Competition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, his neareſt Friends, his Prince, and his Country, muſt become a Sacrifice to his private Intereſt. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that loves himſelf at that rate, as to be an Enemy to Mankind, is very unfit to be a Magiſtrate; for every little proſpect of Gain will pervert his Judgment, and make him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the Cauſe he ſhould maintain. To conclude the Character, Magiſtrates ſhould be known among the People: Not ſuch (ordinarily) as have liv'd in Obſcurity, (tho' ſome of them may be excellent Perſons too,) but Men that have more appear'd in the World, becauſe ſuch as they have liv'd in the Obſervation of publick Buſineſs, and are therefore fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it. This is requiſite alſo for the greater Aſſurance of their Vertues, and the fuller Satisfaction of thoſe that come to them for Juſtice, who will the more readily acquieſce in their Determinations. Every Magiſtrate therefore is to be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Wiſdom and Prudence, of Vertue and Courage, one that fears God, a Man of Truth, hating Covetouſneſs, and that is known among the People. Hoping therefore that I ſpeak to Men of theſe Qualifications, with ſuch other particular Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues as are conſequent to the Fear of God, I do, with the greater Encouragement, beſeech you to execute Righteouſneſs, with all that Wiſdom, Courage, and Zeal which is neceſſary, (eſpecially at ſuch a time as this) according to the Will of God, and the wholſom a Laws of the Nation: You are both the Eyes and Hands of our dread Sovereigns, to find out and puniſh Tranſgreſſors: and which is more, ye are the Deputies of God himſelf, (and therefore call'd Gods in the Holy Scriptures, <hi>Pſal</hi> 82.1, 6.) and in his place and ſtead are to execute Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Earth: Which is neceſſary not only for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a good Conſcience in yourſelves, and the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49406:12"/>of ſuch Sins as are naturally injurious to the Nation, but alſo to prevent God's Judgments upon it; for he is not wont to puniſh a People himſelf, till Sins that are committed by ſome are conniv'd at by others, and the hand of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is ſlack in doing Juſtice upon the Guilty; For what is ſaid of Murder <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.33. <hi>The land cannot be cleanſed of the blood that is ſhed therein, but by the blood of him that ſhed it;</hi> is a Rule to us alſo in reſpect of other Sins, according to their ſeveral Aggravations, and the Puniſhments due to them. The Land contracts Guilt and Defilement from all heinous and open Sins of particular Perſons, if they are not duly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd by thoſe that are authorized to do it: And becauſe a Nation, as ſuch, cannot receive Puniſhment in another World, God will, ſooner or later, viſit them with his Judgments in this: and nothing can prevent him, but a ſeaſonable Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Juſtice by his Vice-gerents, and a Reformation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People. When <hi>Judah</hi> were guilty of many Sins, that were too generally allow'd amongſt them, ſuch as Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Fornication, Adultery, Deceit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with a Remiſſion of Juſtice alſo, (as might well be ſuppos'd in ſo general a Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption among the People,) and God threatned them no leſs then three times by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in theſe emphatical words, <hi>Shall not I viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord? And ſhall not my ſoul be aveng'd on ſuch a nation as this?</hi> As if he challeng'd the whole World to object againſt the neceſſity of it: Yet he promiſes at the ſame time, it there could be found a Man in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that executed Judgment, he would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.1. Yea, when the Wrath of God has already exerted itſelf upon a People, this will put a ſtop to the Effects of it. Thus when <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their Idolatry, and Whoredom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with the Daughters of <hi>Moab,</hi> had a Plague ſent among them, which together with ſome that were ſlain with the Sword, deſtroyed twenty four thouſands of the People; and the brays and heroick <hi>Phineas</hi> ſeeing a great Man of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> bring the Daughter of a <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> Prince to his Tear, in the face of the Congregation, that were now weeping for their Sins,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49406:13"/>and the Anger of God that was broken out upon them, took a Javelin in his hand, and ſlew them both together in the Act of Sin: Immediately upon this Execution, the Plague was ſtaid, and God ſo pleas'd with <hi>Phineas</hi> for it, that he gave unto him the Covenant of an Everlaſting Prieſthood, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this to be regiſter'd to his Honour in all after Ages, <hi>Num.</hi> 25. He was indeed poſſeſs'd of a great Zeal for God, that made him deſpiſe the Dangers he incur'd by this worthy Act, which would certainly procure him very powerful Enemies. But God does uſually protect his Servants in doing his own Work, and preſerve them afterwards notwithstanding all the efforts of Malice and Revenge againſt them: Now tho' <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> was no Magiſtrate, yet at this time he did the part of one, and by an extraordinary Commiſſion; he is therefore a great Example to ſuch, ſo far as they can imitate him in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular way. But when they forbear to do it, God will take the matter into his own hand, and vindicate his Juſtice by ſome terrible Effects of it upon a Nation: Therefore when the Pſalmiſt complains that the Gods upon Earth would not do Juſtice, he calls upon the God of Heaven to judge the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.2, 8. But that the Prophets and righteous Men in this Nation may not have cauſe to do ſo too by your Default, I do again renew my humble Requeſt to you, that you would endeavour to exalt the Nation by ſuch an Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Righteouſneſs as is requir'd of you: And for your far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Encouragement in this matter, be pleaſed to conſider that God has done his part for us, in a moſt gracious manner, in delivering us from the hand of our Enemies, when we ſaw ourſelves very near Deſtruction; and ever ſince has gone on to perfect our Deliverance. The Princes whom God in much Mercy has ſet over us, have done their parts too, not only in ſetting us ſuch Examples of Righteouſneſs as are very rare in the World, eſpecially in ſo eminent a Station; but in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrict Proclamations for the Puniſhment of Vice, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Miniſters to preach earneſtly againſt it, and read thoſe Statutes to their People that were made for the ſuppreſſing of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49406:13"/>it, and in giving a particular Charge to Magiſtrates under them, to execute the Laws upon Offenders. The faithful Servants of God in the Nation of all Ranks, have, in a great meaſure done their parts alſo, in ſincere Humiliations for the Sins of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and praying to Almighty God to reform us, and avert his Judgments from us; and in order to it, to inſpire Magiſtrates with thoſe generous and holy Reſolutions which are neceſſary to accompliſh ſo great a Work: And I cannot but ſay you have ſuch an Opportunity before you of carrying on a great Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Kingdom, as both the preſent and future Ages will for ever praiſe God for, ſo long as there ſhall be any Piety in the World, and will raiſe to yourſelves a laſting Monument of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if you zealouſly embrace it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall in the next place apply myſelf to Miniſters, and humbly recommend to their Conſideration the preſent State of the Church of Chriſt among us; my Brethren, the Souls of the Nation are committed to our Charge; and tho' the Credit of the Miniſtry is grown ſo low, (thro' the Iniquity of the Times, and the unhappy Diviſions that have been in the Kingdom,) that we have not ſo great an Advantage, as Miniſters generally have in other Nations, to perſwade People to be Religious, either by our Lives or Exhortations; yet if a general Care were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us to do what we can, it would certainly produce conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Effects in reforming our People. And what ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Work can we ever be employ'd in, as a ſincere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Endeavour to win Souls to God, and exalt the Nation in that Righteouſneſs which will exalt it in all other reſpects? We have often had Debates amongſt ourſelves, and with Miniſters of other Churches about the uniting all good Proteſtants among us into one National Church: a Bleſſing which one would think a good Chriſtian, ſhould not only part with a few indifferent things in the outward Conſtitution of a Church, but with his own Blood alſo to purchaſe, if that would do it. The Atheiſm, Prophaneneſs, Envy, Strife, Hatred, and other horrid Sins that are very much occaſion'd and ſhelter'd by our Diviſions, ſhould provoke the Zeal of all good Men in every Party to offer what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49406:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>they can towards an Union: But this is chiefly the Concern of Miniſters; and as our Superiours appear well diſpos'd to ſo good a Work, I deſire we may contribute what is in our Power alſo towards it: And if I miſtake not, there is a means to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by us, which will mightily facilitate the matter, and do it more to the Advantage of our Church, then any thing that has been ordinarily propos'd, and that is a ſincere Reformation of of our own Lives, and a zealous Diſcharge of our Miniſtry; I ſpeak not this as a Reproach to any, (for I heartily bleſs God for many holy, learned, and able Miniſters that are amongſt us,) but becauſe we might ſtill be much better, and if we would all ſeriouſly endeavour it; this would ſpeak more loudly and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually for us then the moſt learned Books that have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in our Cauſe, and caſt ſuch a Luſtre upon the Church, as would attract the Affections of the beſt Men in every Party, and cauſe them, upon reaſonable Terms, to Unite with us. And in the uſe of other good Means, let us not ceaſe to pray that God would give us the Bleſſing of good Succeſs in ſo glorious a Work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Having now ſpoken to publick Perſons, both Magiſtrates and Miniſters, I ſhall next addreſs to the Gentry, and together with them all Perſons of Intereſt and Eſtates in what Rank or Order ſoever: And you are ſo great a part of the Nation, and have ſuch a commanding Influence on all below you, that one would think a general Conſent and Endeavour among you would turn almoſt the whole Nation which way you pleaſe: And indeed there is hardly any Corner of the Kingdom but looks like an Earneſt of it; for where-ever Religion is zealouſly practis'd and countenanc'd by the Gentry, we ſee ſuch Effects of it upon others, that almoſt every one in that Pariſh or Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood is a good Chriſtian, or would ſeem to be ſo. But on the contrary, where Looſneſs or Irreligion is ſeen in any of that Rank, how ſtrangely does it corrupt the Minds and Practices of their Inferiors! If your Power therefore be ſo great with others, you can never uſe it ſo well as in promoting Righteouſneſs: for this is to do God and your Country the greateſt Service, and get
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49406:14"/>your ſelves a laſting Name and Honour in the World.</p>
            <p>The very Heathens of old had ſo great an Affection for their Country, that they accounted it a brave and deſirable thing to die for it, when a fit Occaſion was offer'd: And your Anceſtors have on all occaſions ſigna iz'd themſelves by hazarding their Lives in the ſame Cauſe; and I believe many amongſt you would willingly have done ſo, in the War we are now engag'd in, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a potent Enemy: but perhaps your Preſence at Home, for good reaſons, was thought neceſſary: However, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting any thing from our Commanders and Armies abroad, whoſe Valour and Conduct deſerve very great Praiſe, I may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, you have as glorious a part to act in order to our Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as they, (yea, I would ſay more, if I did not conſider ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them as righteous and devout Chriſtians as well as Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,) and that is, to reform your Perſons and Families, ſo far as this is wanting, and encourage Righteouſneſs amongſt your Neighbours. This would prevail with God ſtill to fight our Battels, and bleſs us with Victories and Triumphs till all our Enemies ſhould be ſubdued under us. And I pray conſider how much God expects this from you: Can any be ſo groſs as to think, that he is born to a larger Eſtate, a better Education, and a greater Power and Intereſt in his Country, for no higher end then to live as he pleaſes? The very Law of Nature would teach us (it the Scriptures were ſilent,) that our Perſons, our Eſtates, and whatever other Advantages we have are God's, and are therefore to be employ'd in his Service. And by conſequence, the more any has receiv'd from God, the greater Returns of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Obedience he is to make to him, (as our Saviour alſo has plainly told us, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.48.) And this does much aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate all the Sins of ſuch Men, and make them more heinous then thoſe of meaner Perſons: And I cannot but add farther, That the Generoſity which ſeems natural to Men of your Rank, ſhould make you grateful to God for his Mercies, and zealous in his Service. If you receive a Kindneſs from any Man, you think it a mean and unworthy thing not to make a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Return to him, or at leaſt do what you can towards it:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49406:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>How much more then ſhould you conſider the Author of your Beings, and of all your Bleſſings, to return all poſſible Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements of his Goodneſs to ſo great a Benefactor? Now if any think it would expoſe them to many malicious Cenſures, Reproaches, and Oppoſitions, to attempt a Reformation of Mens Manners, in an Age wherein Sin ſo much abounds, in all Orders of Men; theſe little Diſcouragements are not to be regarded, when the Honour of God, the Good of the Country, and the Eternal Happineſs of your own Souls are ſo much concern'd: It is a ſmall matter to bear the Contradictions of ill Men, while we have the Applauſes of all that are good, and, which is a thouſand times more, the Favour of God himſelf, with true Peace and Satisfaction in our own Conſciences. And indeed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Difficulties any Man meets with in the way of his Duty, the more it recommends his Piety, Courage, and Holy Reſolution in doing it: To dare to practice Righteouſneſs and encourage it in a licentious Age, when too many live as if they were born only for Eaſe and Luxury, is indeed to undergo a leſſer Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, and to ſtand at leaſt in the place of a Confeſſor. But this ſhould rather provoke the Emulation, then move the Fears of all good Men; for to contribute their Power and Intereſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Reforming a Nation, is a greater Service then to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their Lives in its Defence: for they that do this, can ſave it only from the Cruelties of Men, while the other ſo far as they ſucceed in their pious Attempts, reſcue it from the Malice of Devils, and by a Conqueſt over thoſe moſt formidable Enemies, preſerve it from eternal Deſtruction. Theſe Conſiderations I hope are of weight with you; and I deſire it may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd as a father Motive to you, that the Power of thoſe two Orders of Men I before ſpake to, lies eſpecially in you: Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are choſen from among you, and depend greatly on your Aſſiſtance in doing their Duty; and indeed without it there is but little comparatively can be expected from them. Miniſters beſides the relation they ordinarily have to your Families, have, very many of them, their Preferments from you: and all of them do much want your Help and Encouragement in order to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49406:15"/>the Succeſs of their Labours: I beſeech you therefore to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power God has given you, not only among yourſelves, but all other Orders of Men in the Kingdom, Magiſtrates, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and the common People; and to uſe it zealouſly in the Cauſe of God and his Church, and you need not doubt of that Succeſs which the Lord delights to give unto ſuch holy Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. This would make us happy at Home, and victorious Abroad, and ſecure very great Bleſſings to yourſelves and your Poſterity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would ſay ſomething alſo to all Perſons in the general, and deſire you that every one would do his part towards the exalting of the Nation, by repenting of your Sins, and doing Righteouſneſs. It is our Country I am pleading for, that dear Concern to which we owe a thouſand times more regard than to our own Lives; theſe we ſhould willingly offer up, when the neceſſity of our Country requires it; and ſhall we grudge to part with our Sins for it? Shall we not embrace true Religion, when it appears to be ſo neceſſary to ſave the Kingdom? and when the Goodneſs of God does ſo much oblige us to it? It is on this Condition that Victory over Enemies, as well as other Bleſſings are promis'd; and therefore without it we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect God ſhould continue them to us, for, tho' he was pleas'd to turn our Captivity, and has hitherto prevented us with his Goodneſs, he can as eaſily turn our Victories, and with one breath of his Diſpleaſure blaſt all that Proſperity he has lately reſtor'd to us; and I know nothing but a Reformation amongſt us that can prevent it. It puzzles many ſerious and conſidering Men to ſee ſo many ſtrange Acts of Providence for the delivering and ſetling a Nation, which they fear'd had fill'd up all the meaſures of their Sins, and were therefore fitted for an unavoidable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: But if all there great Effects of God's Goodneſs, which we have lately receiv'd, added to the former, will not bring us to Repentance; as our Deſtruction when it comes will be the greater on the account of them, ſo we cannot reaſonably expect it ſhould be long defer'd. And indeed if we do not ſeriouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ourſelves now to the great Duties of Religion, what a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49406:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>will it be to us that we have always with ſo much Heat contended for a Form of Godlineſs? Inſomuch that I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, if half that Zeal had been ſpent for Religion itſelf, as has been for the little Appendages of it, or at the moſt, for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of a Church; we had been, long e're now, the beſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt Nation in the World. It is time therefore that we correct our former Miſtakes, and ſet ourſelves to the practice of that pure and undefiled Religion we profeſs, that we may contribute what lies in us to the Safety and Proſperity of the Kingdom. And at this time it becomes all good Men to deny themſelves more then ordinarily, out of a generous Sympathy m our Fleets and Armies abroad. It was a brave and noble Reſolution of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> had ſent for him from the Army, that he would not take the Comforts of his own Houſe, but choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lie at the King's Gate, while the Ark, and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> abode in Tents, and his Lord <hi>Joab</hi> and the Servants of the King were encamp'd in the open Fields: And are not our <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> ſome of them in Tents too, and others floating upon the Ocean? And beſides them ſeveral brave Armies of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates? And have we not many <hi>Joabs</hi> (great and worthy Commanders) encamp'd in the Field? and which is more, is not our <hi>David</hi> alſo with them? And have we not ſomething in danger there that is greater then the Ark? For our Religion is very much bound up in the Safety of our Prince and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? It becomes us therefore to have a real ſence of theſe things, and exerciſe that Self-denial and Devotion which will beſt expreſs it, and will alſo prevail with God for the Continuance and Increaſe of Publick Bleſſings to us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall ſay ſomething very briefly concerning the Buſineſs of the preſent Time in this Place, wherein ſome (it may be) of all Orders of Men here are concern'd; and put you in mind of the Righteouſneſs that is neceſſary for you to exerciſe in it. And as to thoſe who are Plaintiffs, I would have them conſider it does not become Chriſtians to go to Law for ſmall matters: <hi>Why do ye not rather take wrong?</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle,) <hi>why do ye not rather ſuffer yourſelves to be defrauded?</hi> 1 Cor. 6.7. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49406:16"/>ſhould they for greater matters, if the Difference may be well determin'd without it: And when the Difficulty of the Caſe requires it, the contending Parties are bound to preſerve Charity towards one another notwithſtanding, and each of them ſhould deſire that Juſtice may be done rather then he ſhould gain the Cauſe: For Juſtice is God's, and therefore to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before our own Intereſt. And as to Witneſſes, I adviſe them, by all means, to keep a good Conſcience, and neither for Love or Hatred, for the hopes of Gain, or fear of any Man's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, to depart from the Truth: <hi>For lying lips are abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 12.22. And Lies in this caſe are dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perjuries, which contain in them ſo many horrid Sins againſt God and our Neighbour, that a Man muſt be extreamly hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Wickedneſs, before he can deliberately forſwear himſelf. For in this kind of Perjury there is a moſt impudent Profanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Name of God, a Violation of the Truth, a perverting of Juſtice, a Treachery to the King and the Laws, a bold Affront to the whole Court, that are deceiv'd and miſguided by it, and an Abuſe to the Country: Beſides, if a Neighbour's good Name be expos'd by it, it is a baſe Slander; it his Goods, it is Theft; if his Life, it is Murder. Therefore it is no wonder God has threaten'd, <hi>That a falſe Witneſs ſhall not be unpuniſh'd, and he that ſpeaketh lies ſhall periſh,</hi> Prov. 19.9. <hi>And that the curſe of God ſhall enter into the Houſe of him that sweareth falſly,</hi> Zach. 5.4. And as to Pleaders, I deſire they would always (as I hope many do) have a greater Reſpect to Truth and Juſtice, then to any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Advantages: and tho' it be their Duty to defend a good Cauſe, and I think none will blame them to make the beſt of one that is doubtful, yet their Busineſs in both theſe Caſes muſt be ever managed with that Decency and Gravity which becomes their Profeſſion, and with that Fairneſs to Witneſſes which the Law of Juſtice does require. But when a Cauſe appears to be bad, to plead this is to be an Advocate againſt Truth and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and conſequently againſt God himſelf. And then what can be expected by ſuch Men, but the Effects of that Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Iſ. 5.20, 23. <hi>Wo unto them that call evil good, and good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49406:17"/>—Which juſtifie the wicked for reward, and take away the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the righteous from him.</hi> And I hope they will believe the wiſe Man when he tells us, <hi>He that juſtifies the wicked, and he that condemns the juſt, even they both are abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 17.15. In a word, let thoſe that are to be Jurors conſider what ſhall be before them with all Sincerity, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min according to their Conſciences upon <hi>good Deliberation,</hi> and not ſuffer themſelves to be biaſs'd by any Conſideration whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And let them, with all others that have any Buſineſs in Courts of Judicature, remember always that excellent <hi>Rule of Juſtice</hi> deliver'd by our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> Mat. 7.12. <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now (my Lords) my Diſcourſe would turn to you, if I had not ſaid ſo much already to Magiſtrates in general, of which, notwithſtanding, I believe your Lordſhips needed very little, or nothing, either to put you in mind of your great Duty, or to quicken you in it. And I think both myſelf and others have great reaſon to bleſs God, that he has graciouſly reſtor'd to us Judges as at the firſt, and Counſellors as at the beginning, from whom we may expect an Execution of our Laws, according to the true Intention of them: and by whoſe means we hope Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will run every-where amongſt us as the Waters, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as a mighty ſtream of Water, and refreſh all the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Land. And as I queſtion not but your Lordſhips will uſe that Power and Intereſt you have to promote Righteouſneſs in general: ſo I do again deſire all Orders of Men here (as my laſt Requeſt to them) to do their parts alſo towards it; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, that the ſame Righteouſneſs which exalts a Nation will at length exalt us alſo to the Kingdom of Heaven, where for all the Service we do, and the Self-denial and Sufferings we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in the Cauſe of God and his Church here, we ſhall receive a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</p>
